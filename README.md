# SMRxT, Inc.

[SMRxT](http://smrxt.com) (pronounced Smart) is a startup that's focused on improving patient medication adherence. Using a proprietary "smart" pill bottle, we collect data on how much and when a patient takes their medication. This data helps our customers intervene to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes. The technology we're creating is a game changer for the healthcare industry that impacts both caregivers and patients in a positive way.

SMRxT believes that maintaining a healthy work life balance is important to producing a quality product. We do not ask for or require time outside of a normal work week. There will be times, however, given the nature of a start up that late nights will happen.

Quality comes first. We are committed to producing an excellent product that meets and exceeds the needs of our customers. We believe that doing the job right is important when the safety others depends on our product.

We are looking for Kansas City based engineers. We enjoy flexibility and autonomy, and we do not expect everyone to work from the office every day, only that you show your smiling face occasionally. We use modern, cloud-based services so we can work from anywhere; including that park or coffee shop you love (no VPN required).


Vacation days are not required to attend developer conferences or other job-related events. We encourage our engineers to keep up with the latest and greatest technologies and apply them as they see fit to improve our organization.
